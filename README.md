# IESopt Project Template

This allows setting up pre-defined project structures for IESopt projects.

## Using this template

> This requires that `git` and `uv` are installed on your system. Consult the installation instructions for [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/windows) if you don't have them installed yet.


Execute the following command in a terminal to create a new project (inside the current working directory) using this template

```bash
uvx cookiecutter gh:ait-energy/iesopt-project-template
```

and answer the questions in the terminal. For example, if you exectute the command in `C:\Users\username\dev`, the new project will automatically be created in `C:\Users\username\dev\your_project_name`.

## Remarks

The template contains various `.gitkeep` files, which are used to keep empty directories in the repository. These files are not necessary for the project and can be removed if desired.
